        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>This guide assumes you already have NPM/NodeJS installed on your machine. If this is not the case please download and install from their <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">website</a>. It is highly recomended that you install it with the option to run from the command line. </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <h3>Install Grunt</h3>

              <p>Go to <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">grunt's website</a> if you do not recall the install command for it. Sit back and let that process run. Maybe take a bathroom break.
              </p>
              <pre>
              npm install -g grunt-cli
              </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Create a gruntfile</h3>
              <p>Grunt be installed now it is time to create a gruntfile. Create a new file and save it as Gruntfile.js.  Naming, very important. All gruntfiles start with the following syntax so you will need to add it to your gruntfile. This tells the gruntfile to initialize and holds the blueprints of what it can do.</p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
                'use strict';
                  module.exports = function (grunt) {
                  grunt.initConfig({
           
                  });
                }
              </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Create a package.json</h3>
              <p>So what does this do? It will be where we save what plugins/dependencies we use. Grunt is magic, but it needs plugins to do more magic. This file is going to allow us to store our setup for future reference or for others to use. Creating one of these helps to install everything you used swiftly and easily. It also allows your teammates to easily install the plugins you used without hunting them down. In addition, it will provide a type of version control. There are a few things that are package.json file needs: name, version, and dependency fields.</p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
                {
                  "name": "Learn-Grunt",
                  "version": "1.0.0",
                  "dependencies": {},
                  "devDependencies": {}
                }
              </pre>
              </li>

            <li>
            <h3>Okay so what now?</h3>
              <p>Awesome so now we have our gruntfile setup, but what is so wrong with this page? No styles right? Well let us fix this mess. Notice the index file makes a call for a CSS file? Well looking in the CSS folder shows this file doesn't exist! Oh noes! Well... I have Bootstrap Sass... so maybe I should compile that into CSS? Break out them Google-Fu skills. We need a plugin.</p>
              <p>Most grunt plugins start with the grunt- prefix so let's do a search for grunt-sass. There are two plugins, but this is the flavor you will need since it doesn't rely on having Ruby. <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass" target="_blank">Sass-plugin</a></p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Installing dat sass</h3>
              <p>Using the grunt-sass plugin repo we are going to follow their instructions on how to install. Most can be install by doing 'npm install plugin-name'. In this plugin's case it is</p>
              <code>
              npm install grunt-sass --save-dev
              </code>
              <p>The '--save-dev' are flags that save the plugin to the package.json file you created as a dependency. This basically says that this plugin is a dev dependency and needs to be saved into the package.json file. The package.json acts like a grocery list for NPM. It tells NPM when 'npm install' is called that it needs to grab these plugins and/or libraries from NPM's registry and install them. There are many more flags that are used in NPM. To learn about them all please visit NPM's documentation on it. Anything that starts with '-' stands for a flag in Node. Now let's wait for the sass plugin to finish installing. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Getting sass compiling</h3>
              <p>
                With the plugin installed, we need to tell grunt what to do with it. Crack open that gruntfile again. Again let's refer to the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass" target="_blank">sass plugin repo</a> on how to configure our settings. Within our grunt file we will need to add a sass task, and of course we need to give it a 'source file' and a 'destination file'. Just like calling css in html, the file path had to be relative to the Gruntfile. The source file is the master sass file (hopefully not a partial if you did it right) that tells grunt to compile all of the imports and declarations in it to a CSS file. The destination file is the CSS file that these declarations are written to.  I have also changed the 'dist' subtask to read 'dev' as it falls more in line with our naming conventions. 
              </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
                sass: {
                  dev: {
                      src: 'scss/bootstrap.scss',
                      dest: 'css/site.css'
                  }
                 }
              </pre>
              <p>
                Some plugins like this one also take a shorthand version of this format. Shorthand is a little strange in its formatting in that it puts the output file first and then the source file. Most plugins also contain an 'options' configuration. This modifies how the task behaves. In the case below I have added an option setting the sourceMap to true. This will create a mapping file so when I look at the compiled CSS file, I can see which scss files and line number a declaration came from.
              </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
                sass: {
                options: {
                    sourceMap: true
                  },
                  dev: {
                    files: {
                      'css/site.css' : 'scss/bootstrap.scss'
                    }
                  }
                }
              </pre> 
              <p>Almost there! We've told Grunt how we want to manipulate the files, but now we have to tell it yes this plugin is installed please let's use it. How do we do that? Load the sass task in. We will do this by adding a line of code to our grunt file. After ending of the <code>grunt.initConfig</code> function you need to add this line: <code>grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sass');</code></p>
              
              <p>Open that command line and navigate to your project folder if you are not already there.  Now run <code>grunt sass</code>. Barring any errors you should now see the css file has been compiled. Refresh this page, now isn't that better? Congratulations you have configured your first grunt file! Now let's practice some more on other plugins we use. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>An aside on calling grunt tasks from command line</h3>
              <p>You can call any grunt task from the command line using grunt followed by the object name of the task. In the case of the one above the object name is 'sass', so grunt sass invokes it to run</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Concat some javascript</h3>
              <p>
                Now we are going to repeat a similar process to get our javascript concatenating. We are going to do a search for 'grunt-contrib-concat'. You want the repo that is done by the gruntjs team. Following the same steps we used for grunt-sass, install the plugin. Once the plugin is installed create the configuration for it in the gruntfile. Hint: the destination file should be js/site.js. Your source files should be any library files and/or project specific javascript files. In this case we are pulling in JQuery and script-learngrunt as our source files. We will also want to set options to give us a sourceMap.  
                </p>
                <button class="btn">show code</button>
                <pre>
                  concat: {
                    dev: {
                      src: ['js/jquery/jquery.min.js'],
                      dest: 'js/site.js'
                    }
                  }
                </pre>  
                <p>
                  Run <code>grunt concat</code>. If you now see a site.js (with code not an empty file!) appear in your js folder then the script has run successfully.
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Getting more complex (watching your files)</h3>
              <p>
                You say the sass and concat is all nice, but alas I still have to enter these commands everytime I update the javascript and scss files for I am le lazy. Have no fear there is a plugin for this too! It is known as 'grunt-contrib-watch'. So let's visit that <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch">repo</a>. The configuration is a little different than the other two plugins we have. The watch task watches the files you tell it to and runs a task according to when those files change. It doesn't rely on a destination and source file, instead it watches the files you tell it to for a save/delete/creation action. It will then run a task or tasks depending on the type of file which you will tell which tasks you want it to run. Read the full documentation of the plugin to understand all of the features it offers. For our purposes we are setting up a SCSS, JS, and HTML subtask with reload enabled. 
              </p>
              <p>For the SCSS subtask we need it to watch all of the .scss files and then run the sass task. For JS it should just know to reload the page on save and the same goes for the HTML subtask.
              </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
              watch: {
                scss: {
                  files: "scss/*.scss",
                  tasks: ['sass'],
                  options: { livereload:true }
                },
                html: {
                  files: '*.html',
                  options: { livereload:true }
                }
              }
              </pre>
              <p>The last step is to add a call to the livereload server at the bottom of your index.html file. <code>&lt;script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> This is going to allow the livereload server to refresh the page after the tasks are completed.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Syncing them browsers</h3>
              <p>For this next step to work properly please go and do a global install of your machine of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a>. <code>npm install -g browser-sync</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                So you want others to view your project over the network or have all the browsers refresh without you doing anything? Now it is time to move on to installing the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/shakyShane/grunt-browser-sync">grunt-browser-sync</a> plugin. Going through the same procedure, install the plugin, write in the load task for grunt, and configure the plugin. Browser sync relies on the bsfiles (yes get out all of your giggles) subtask for which files it should be reading. In our case we want it to watch all scss and javascript files. For right now we have only one HTML page, you can choose to watch just the index file or have it watch all HTML files. We are building out the static file server configuration. If you were working on say a MVC or SiteCore project, you would need to do the proxy configuration. We will also need to tell the task that watchtask is true within the options setting. This ensures that BrowserSync and watch play nicely with each other. This will become more important in our next step.
              </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
                browserSync: {
                  bsFiles: {
                    src: [
                      'css/site.css',
                      'index.html',
                      'js/site.js'
                    ]
                  },
                  options: {
                    server: {
                      baseDir: './'
                    },
                    watchTask: true
                  }
                }
              </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Create a grunt task</h3>
              <p>Scary yes? We can work through this. We are goinng to set up a simple task. This task will call sass, browsersync, and finally watch all with one command! We are goig to call it 'debug'. You can find Grunt's official documentation on creating a task on their <a target="_blank" href="http://gruntjs.com/creating-tasks">website</a>. Taken from their site this is the basic format of a grunt task.
              </p>
              <pre>
                grunt.registerTask(taskName, [description, ] taskList);
              </pre>
              <p>Here we do not use the description field since we have a default task in our framework that gives you this information. The task should be placed after your loadNPMtasks section of the Gruntfile. You can add it before without issues, but for the sake of consistency place it after. If done correctly when you run the command <code>grunt development</code> nthe command line should run sass, browsersync, and a page will open up in the browser with this site.
              </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
                grunt.registerTask('dev', ['sass', 'concat', 'browserSync', 'watch']);
              </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Environments</h3>
              <p>
                Now that we have a basic watch task and browser sync setup we can have a discssion about environments. So far we have been working in a development environment. We are not minifying files or changing the CSS and JS paths to reflect moving to a release environment. These next few steps are going to move us through a basic environment setup so we can process files for development, testing, and release.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Development - creation of the website/app</li>
                <li>Testing - testing environment when users are running through to find bugs</li>
                <li>Deploy - App/Website is being deployed to the public facing servers</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We've already created a task for development, so that is a third of the battle. For the testing environment our aim is to concat the javascript files, prepare css styles for legacy browsers, and change the file paths on the index.html to reflect these concatenated files. Release our goal is to expand on testing's tasks to minify our files. We don't have all of the plugins to accomplish this, so we are going to grab them and set them up.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Uglifying Javascript</h3>
              <p>
                First in our plugin trip towards environment conscious gruntfiles is to install and configure a javascript minification plugin. In this exercise we are going to use the official one from GruntJS, <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify" target="_blank">grunt-contrib-uglify</a>. Follow through the instructions on the repo to install and insert the loadNpmTasks into your gruntfile. What we want to do here is take a src file (site.js) and output the destination file as site.min.js. Looking at the examples in the repo, we want to most closely follow the basic compression model. In the example I have used long hand so my configuration is more easily read.
              </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
              uglify: {
                deploy: {
                  src: 'js/site.js',
                  dest: 'js/site.min.js'
                }
              }
              </pre>
              <p>Test the configuration by using <code>grunt ugilfy</code>. If all runs smoothly you should now see a site.min.js file in your javascript folder.
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <h3>Preening CSS</h3>
              <p>
                Libraries like Bootstrap are great, but they can add quite a bit of overhead in code that we don't use. We are going to take an awesome plugin utilizing uncss to remove unused CSS declaration. <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/grunt-uncss" target="_blank">Grunt-uncss</a> will do just that for us. You know the drill follow the instructions to install this plugin. What uncss does is compare your css file to your html files to find and match declartions. If a declaration is not found, it will be deleted from the css file. Here we will be creating two subtasks: testing and deploy. For testing the source file(s) will be any .html file that uncss needs to parse through. The destination file should be the site.css file that you created earlier. For deploy we want the src file to remain the same, but the destination file should be site.min.css. We are also going to add the option of report min. Having these two tasks will be important for later.
              </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
              uncss: {
                testing: {
                  src: '*.html',
                  dest: 'css/site.css'
                },

                deploy: {
                  options: {
                    report: 'min'
                  },
                  src: '*.html',
                  dest: 'css/site.min.css'
                }
              }
              </pre>
              <p>
                Once everything has been installed and configured test it out to make sure it works. You should see where the site.css file is made into a much smaller version. <code>grunt uncss</code> If there are any javascript added classes you will need to add an option to the configuration to ignore those classes. You can find out how to do this on the plugin's repo. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Autoprefixer and its wonders</h3>
              <p>
                This plugin will take care of browser prefixes and add them to your CSS for compatibility purposes. With this plugin you will be telling it how many versions back you need it to render out for you. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer" target="_blank">repo</a> and configure your gruntfile. We want the source and destination file to be our site.css file. The options we will set up for this example will be the 'last 2 versions' for it to render out.
                </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>

                },
                dev: {
                  src: 'css/site.css',
                  dest: 'css/site.css'
                }

              <h3>Environment Switching</h3>
              <p>
                Now we are going to install and configure an environment switcher. For our examples we are going to use <a href="https://github.com/ArcaneMainFrame/grunt-captain-hook" target="_blank">grunt-captain-hook</a>. While there are many options out there for this, captain-hook was created to suit our unique needs within the company architexture. Follow through the instructions to get the plugin installed. With this one we want the jsfiles to reflect the file(s) used per environment. For development we want all of the javascript files including the path for the livereload server to work. For testing we want the unminifed site.js file. Finally for deploy we want to use the min js file. For the css files, development and testing will be the same referring to the site.css file. For deploy we want the site.min.css file. We are going to use subtasks to achieve this. So far you have just be using one subtask per configuration. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Looking back at a prior example of the sass task we configure, you will notice an object named 'dev' that contains all of the references to the src files and dest files. 'dev' in this case is a subtask referring to the 'development' environment. Expanding upon that concept we are creating a 'dev' for development, 'testing' for testing, and 'deploy' for the deployment environments.
              </p>
              <button class="btn">show code</button>
              <pre>
              captain_hook: {
                dev: {
                  cssFiles: 'css/site.css',
                  jsFiles: [
                    'js/**/*.js',
                    '//localhost:35729/livereload.js',
                    "!js/site.js",
                    "!js/site.min.js"
                  ],
                  targetHtml: '*.html'
                },

                testing: {
                  cssFiles: 'css/site.css',
                  jsFiles: 'js/site.js',
                  targetHtml: '*.html' 
                },

                deploy: {
                  cssFiles: 'css/site.min.css',
                  jsFiles: 'js/site.min.js',
                  targetHtml: '*.html'
                }
              }
              </pre>
              <p>
                You should also add the CSS and JS start and end tags to your HTML. The instructions can be found on the plugin's repo. Now we are going to test each subtask individually. You can do this very simply. Instead of calling just <code>grunt captain_hook</code> you will call it by task with a ':' and the subtask name immediately following like so: <code>grunt captain_hook:testing</code>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Bringing it all together</h3>
              <p>
                We have all the plugins set up to create the environment specific tasks. Just like in the prior lesson we are going to string together when tasks run to create a testing command and a deploy command. The testing task should concentrate on bundling files and taking care of browser prefixes. Here I have told it to run concat, sass, autoprefixer, uncss:testing, and finally captain_hook:testing. Deploy should be similar but with minification tasks added. Concat, uglify, sass, autoprefixer, uncss:deploy, and captain_hook:deploy.
              </p>

              <pre>
              grunt.registerTask('testing', ['concat', 'sass', 'autoprefixer', 'uncss:testing', 'captain_hook:testing']);
              grunt.registerTask('deploy', ['concat', 'uglify', 'sass', 'autoprefixer', 'uncss:deploy', 'captain_hook:deploy']);
